This project is part of a fork of a Java library which also has been translated to C#.
The source code is located here:
https://github.com/TomasJohansson/adapters-shortest-paths-dotnet/
The current name of the subproject (within the current Visual Studio solution) 
with the translated C# code: "Programmerare.ShortestPaths.Adaptee.Bsmock.Test"

The location of the original project:
https://github.com/bsmock/k-shortest-paths

The license of the translated C# code is the same as the original project i.e. Apache License 2.0 
https://github.com/bsmock/k-shortest-paths/blob/master/LICENSE

The forked version, and the C# translation, has tried to NOT modify the implementation of the algorithm.
The purpose of the translated C# code was to make it into a C# project AND to also make it available with NuGet.
