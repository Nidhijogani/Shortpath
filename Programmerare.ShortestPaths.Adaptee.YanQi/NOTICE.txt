This project is a fork of a Java library which also has been translated to C#.
The source code is located here:
TODO URL Programmerare.ShortestPaths.Adaptee.YanQi

The location of the original project:
https://github.com/yan-qi/k-shortest-paths-java-version

The license of the fork is the same as the original project i.e. Apache License 2.0 
https://github.com/yan-qi/k-shortest-paths-java-version/blob/master/License.txt

The forked version has tried to NOT modify the implementation of the algorithm.
The purpose of the fork was to make it into a C# project and also available with NuGet.
TODO: some comments about the changes ...
(i.e. replace the below comments from the forked Java project...)


The forked version has NOT modified the implementation of the algorithm.
The purpose of the fork was to enable more flexible Graph creation, i.e. programmatic  
construction of the Graph as an alternative to the construction from text file input.

The PREVIOUSLY EXISTING java packages in the ORIGINAL project begin with the following name:
edu.asu.emit.algorithm (edu.asu.emit.algorithm.graph and edu.asu.emit.algorithm.utils)

The NEW files (i.e. files ADDED in this fork) are located within the following java package:
com.programmerare.edu.asu.emit.algorithm.graph

In other words, the NEW package begin with the prefix "com.programmerare" and then an original package name as suffix.

The only of the PREVIOUSLY EXISTING  java files which has been MODIFIED is the class "Graph".
It was refactored with extraction of code into two new methods in git commit 7130ed623d6e7436cdb8294c0e142a8b4b29a18d
