This C# project is part of a fork of a Java library which also has been translated to C#.
The source code is located here:
https://github.com/TomasJohansson/adapters-shortest-paths-dotnet/
The current name of the subproject (within the current Visual Studio solution) 
with the translated C# code: "Programmerare.ShortestPaths.Adaptee.YanQi.Test"

The location of the original Java project:
https://github.com/yan-qi/k-shortest-paths-java-version

The license of the translated C# code is the same as the original project i.e. Apache License 2.0 
https://github.com/yan-qi/k-shortest-paths-java-version/blob/master/License.txt

The forked version, and the C# translation, has tried to NOT modify the implementation of the algorithm.
The purpose of the translated C# code was to make it into a C# project AND to also make it available with NuGet.

Below is the documentation about what was changed in the forked Java version
compared to the original Java version:
(pasted from the URL https://github.com/TomasJohansson/k-shortest-paths-java-version/blob/master/NOTICE.txt )
---------------------------------------------
This project is a fork. The source code is located here:
https://github.com/TomasJohansson/k-shortest-paths-java-version

The location of the original project:
https://github.com/yan-qi/k-shortest-paths-java-version/tree/master/src/main/java/edu/asu/emit/algorithm/graph


The forked version has NOT modified the implementation of the algorithm.
The purpose of the fork was to enable more flexible Graph creation, i.e. programmatic  
construction of the Graph as an alternative to the construction from text file input.

The PREVIOUSLY EXISTING java packages in the ORIGINAL project begin with the following name:
edu.asu.emit.algorithm (edu.asu.emit.algorithm.graph and edu.asu.emit.algorithm.utils)

The NEW files (i.e. files ADDED in this fork) are located within the following java package:
com.programmerare.edu.asu.emit.algorithm.graph

In other words, the NEW package begin with the prefix "com.programmerare" and then an original package name as suffix.

The only of the PREVIOUSLY EXISTING  java files which has been MODIFIED is the class "Graph".
It was refactored with extraction of code into two new methods in git commit 7130ed623d6e7436cdb8294c0e142a8b4b29a18d
